Harry how are you

50
  
yeah uh thank you for the intro

51
  
yeah I'm doing really well

52
  
um summer in Berlin so far has been a lot of rain

53
  
um which is currently stopped for a little bit

54
  
maybe I see a bit of sunlight but um

55
  
apart from that

56
  
all good thanks

57
  
mate awesome

58
  
so you were born and now you're here talking to me

59
  
tell me what happened in between

60
  
so originally

61
  
I was born in the Midlands in the UK

62
  
moved up to the North East of England

63
  
got to mention that

64
  
hence the accent

65
  
yeah I'm very big part of my personality

66
  
um and then from there

67
  
I started learning to play drums when I was about ten

68
  
and instantly threw myself into playing with bands

69
  
like with my friends

70
  
which really sparked um

71
  
I love for music

72
  
specifically live music at the time

73
  
playing in bands and just generally um

74
  
I guess listen to all different types of genres

75
  
whatever it may be

76
  
um this sort of was a complete

77
  
a constant throughout my

78
  
like adolescence

79
  
like my teen years

80
  
just playing music

81
  
being surrounded by musical people

82
  
um which kinda translated to again

83
  
playing in lots of different types of bands

84
  
um and then eventually making the move to uh

85
  
Brighton um

86
  
from there um

87
  
I was studying music business

88
  
um bin and I was also against still playing a bands

89
  
and at the time um

90
  
one of my bands they

91
  
we got picked up by some fairly reputable managers

92
  
which is really cool

93
  
because I was learning about the music industry

94
  
before that

95
  
I had a very DIY approach

96
  
but then I was working with the team and

97
  
you know really getting to apply

98
  
um what I was learning um

99
  
so some really cool like uh

100
  
opportunities came out from that um

101
  
we played out in like Glastonbury

102
  
South Korea

103
  
South Korea

104
  
uh reading the Leeds Festival

105
  
and really got to see some like um

106
  
the inside of the music industry that you

107
  
getting taught about

108
  
um you know

109
  
on like paper

110
  
and so from there

111
  
ended up graduating

112
  
the band kinda dissolved very naturally

113
  
um and then yeah

114
  
sorry job opportunity over here in Berlin

115
  
working for a gaming music company

116
  
 vectors um

117
  
who had daily playlist under their repertoire

118
  
of their products

119
  
um that they're working on um

120
  
and from there yeah

121
  
really made the jump

122
  
um my other side to me

123
  
as well as being um

124
  
really into my like punk

125
  
garage rock music

126
  
first and foremost

127
  
is I'm a massive nerd

128
  
absolutely massive nerd so um

129
  
working within a space where it was a crossover

130
  
between gaming and music

131
  
and esports and all of this coming together

132
  
it seemed like a bit of a too good to be true situation

133
  
especially with

134
  
the opportunity to move out here to Berlin um

135
  
so yeah from there

136
  
I started working on daily playlist

137
  
like back in like 

138
  
um with the original founder um

139
  
but also working across the host of projects which um

140
  
you mentioned there

141
  
and yeah what was it

142
  
like  now

143
  
and then yeah

144
  
sort of now only working on daily playlists um

145
  
but yeah it was um

146
  
along the way picked up a whole host of um

147
  
experiences working across different technologies

148
  
I'm working with different types of music campaigns

149
  
looking at it from like the tech angle

150
  
but also still

151
  
looking at it from the independent artist angle

152
  
the label angle and uh

153
  
really keeping the post on what is going on within

154
  
the music industry

155
  
so get in for me

156
  
I guess the perfect like 

157
  
 view of um

158
  
my little space

159
  
that's it oh

160
  
it's amazing

161
  
and and you know

162
  
that's what so many of our listeners

163
  
especially are in that

164
  
that independent music space

165
  
but you know

166
  
combined with the business

167
  
and technology aspects as well

168
  
so um jumping into Daily Playlist as well

169
  
which is one of the reasons why I reached out to you uh

170
  
it's one of the few playlist companies we recommend

171
  
at The Label Machine

172
  
it's very popular

173
  
are you guys

174
  
do a great job over there

175
  
can you give us a

176
  
quick rundown of what Daily Playlists is at its essence

177
  
and a rundown of

178
  
what are your main activities are there

179
  
mm hmm so in it's car essence

180
  
Daily Playlist is a very simple and easy to use

181
  
a playlist submission platform um

182
  
we really automate the play uh

183
  
the process

184
  
so artists can go through a flow of entering the song

185
  
just searching for it

186
  
connecting to the platform via the Spotify uh

187
  
Spotify login

188
  
and then having uh

189
  
been able to select from over  playlists

190
  
to submit to

191
  
or over  premium curators

192
  
which I can get into a bit later um

193
  
for the curator inside the things we again

194
  
really pride ourselves in simplifying and automating

195
  
the processes where

196
  
the curators can organise

197
  
can fill the through submissions um

198
  
and can easily find the right music for their playlist

199
  
while also um

200
  
having a platform which allows them to grow

201
  
and monetize um

202
  
their brands and profiles

203
  
hmm so what

204
  
how does the

205
  
cause I believe if you got a free account

206
  
you can get  credits and is

207
  
is that essentially 

208
  
submissions

209
  
is that right

210
  
yeah exactly

211
  
so that's a very much like a  to 

212
  
um yeah value

213
  
okay so I I

214
  
I've submitted my

215
  
my music what's the

216
  
what I mean

217
  
what's the I mean

218
  
 people love daily playlist

219
  
cause you can submit to  playlists for free

220
  
what's the uh

221
  
how does the business model work

222
  
like how do you

223
  
you know how does the company

224
  
sort of make money if there's no financial

225
  
movement round it

226
  
so we do have two different monetization layers

227
  
so one of these is our Artist Pro

228
  
um layer which is a subscription plan

229
  
which you can get for  per month

230
  
or hundred and fifty dollars per year

231
  
um which basically gives you tools

232
  
which allow you to make the most

233
  
of daily playlist

234
  
really expand on um

235
  
your experience

236
  
on the site

237
  
so um we can get into the individual products um

238
  
on a deeper level in a bit

239
  
but we have a tool which automates

240
  
automatically submits to playlist for you

241
  
um which we have a algorithm which you built

242
  
which can basically

243
  
match your submission to the playlist

244
  
um based on the playlist

245
  
like quality

246
  
um we also have the ability to add uh

247
  
pre saves to what we called the gate system

248
  
um which means that if you have a playlist

249
  
or if you wanna create a contest

250
  
you can then have the terms and conditions of the

251
  
entry or submission

252
  
to being pre saving the release

253
  
um and then also we um

254
  
have a number of other features

255
  
which include like uh

256
  
our trending list

257
  
our track Explorer

258
  
and very community based

259
  
engagement um

260
  
is because we have a very

261
  
very active community

262
  
which is super

263
  
um open but then on the other side

264
  
we have the premium layer for curators

265
  
in which we have a very

266
  
heavily vetted um

267
  
marketplace of curators who have got um

268
  
proven engagement

269
  
genuine um quality to the curation

270
  
and their branding

271
  
especially is what we look at

272
  
and just very much

273
  
established within the space

274
  
so for $ per submission

275
  
you can submit to these curators

276
  
when we split that 

277
  
 in the curators favour

278
  
per submission that they review

279
  
ah gotchain

280
  
so can people just submit anytime to those

281
  
premium playlists

282
  
would you have to be on the membership model

283
  
for that to work

284
  
so anyone can buy

285
  
so we have two different um

286
  
credit types

287
  
we have the standard credits

288
  
which are the ones that you get every week to 

289
  
that refresh on a Monday um

290
  
and then we also have the premium credits um

291
  
which you can purchase

292
  
I think for 

293
  
um it is 

294
  
 and for  it's  um

295
  
and then you can freely spend those premium credits to

296
  
the premium curators

297
  
so rather than submitting to an individual playlist

298
  
you submit to a curator

299
  
who then evaluates and gives you feedback on the um

300
  
on your submission and um

301
  
if it's a fit for their profile

302
  
they'll select which playlist and position

303
  
they wanna add you to

304
  
and whereas

305
  
I guess the difference from that to the standard

306
  
submissions is that on the standard side

307
  
you submit directly to a playlist

308
  
interesting yeah

309
  
so are you seeing then a trend

310
  
of when you talk about a curator is a

311
  
is a curator

312
  
like someone who manages

313
  
a bunch of playlists

314
  
essentially

315
  
in this case

316
  
yeah so curators

317
  
you know the world of music curation is huge

318
  
you haven't uh

319
  
channels such as like colours

320
  
um circle and those muscle

321
  
like even by boiling right there

322
  
like music curation in a

323
  
in a sense yeah

324
  
then you have

325
  
in our essence

326
  
you working with the playlisters who have um

327
  
assets which are the playlist

328
  
which they spend a lot of time mastering the growth

329
  
mastering the curation aspects and that branding

330
  
um and yeah

331
  
so that's that's how we

332
  
when I refer to curators on

333
  
in this case

334
  
I'm talking about like the playlist is

335
  
um so yeah gotcha

336
  
and when you're saying

337
  
is why you're submitting to the curators the

338
  
the premium and

339
  
and you'd get

340
  
they would review it

341
  
and see which playlist they would add it to

342
  
are you getting is this

343
  
is the artist submitting or whatever submitting

344
  
getting actual feedback from like

345
  
you know like

346
  
I guess the quality of the song or the style

347
  
or you know

348
  
are they getting that kind of constructive feedback

349
  
or is it more just yeah

350
  
we think we can work for it or no

351
  
we can't what

352
  
what sort of depth does it go to

353
  
so in the current setup

354
  
if a curator accepts the song

355
  
they don't necessarily have to leave a comment
