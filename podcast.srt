00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,466
all good thanks

57
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,066
mate awesome

58
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:11,500
so you were born and now you're here talking to me

59
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,400
tell me what happened in between

60
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,600
so originally

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,133
I was born in the Midlands in the UK

62
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,500
moved up to the North East of England

63
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,333
got to mention that

64
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,833
hence the accent

65
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,966
yeah I'm very big part of my personality

66
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,000
um and then from there

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,233
I started learning to play drums when I was about ten

68
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,900
and instantly threw myself into playing with bands

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
like with my friends

70
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,100
which really sparked um

71
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
I love for music

72
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,600
specifically live music at the time

73
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,266
playing in bands and just generally um

74
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,866
I guess listen to all different types of genres

75
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,100
whatever it may be

76
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,700
um this sort of was a complete

77
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,933
a constant throughout my

78
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:52,766
like adolescence

79
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:53,733
like my teen years

80
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:54,733
just playing music

81
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,866
being surrounded by musical people

82
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
um which kinda translated to again

83
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
playing in lots of different types of bands

84
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,200
um and then eventually making the move to uh

85
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,566
Brighton um

86
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,966
from there um

87
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,766
I was studying music business

88
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:12,500
um bin and I was also against still playing a bands

89
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,366
and at the time um

90
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,333
one of my bands they

91
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,166
we got picked up by some fairly reputable managers

92
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,066
which is really cool

93
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,733
because I was learning about the music industry

94
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:22,333
before that

95
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,166
I had a very DIY approach

96
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,900
but then I was working with the team and

97
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,833
you know really getting to apply

98
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,300
um what I was learning um

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
so some really cool like uh

100
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,900
opportunities came out from that um

101
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,500
we played out in like Glastonbury

102
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,166
South Korea

103
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,200
South Korea

104
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,666
uh reading the Leeds Festival

105
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,166
and really got to see some like um

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,966
the inside of the music industry that you

107
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:45,800
getting taught about

108
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,266
um you know

109
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,366
on like paper

110
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,033
and so from there

111
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,500
ended up graduating

112
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,966
the band kinda dissolved very naturally

113
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,600
um and then yeah

114
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,766
sorry job opportunity over here in Berlin

115
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,500
working for a gaming music company

116
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,366
5 vectors um

117
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,700
who had daily playlist under their repertoire

118
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,000
of their products

119
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,733
um that they're working on um

120
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:07,966
and from there yeah

121
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,066
really made the jump

122
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,700
um my other side to me

123
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
as well as being um

124
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,133
really into my like punk

125
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,200
garage rock music

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,466
first and foremost

127
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,666
is I'm a massive nerd

128
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,466
absolutely massive nerd so um

129
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,000
working within a space where it was a crossover

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,033
between gaming and music

131
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,000
and esports and all of this coming together

132
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,066
it seemed like a bit of a too good to be true situation

133
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:31,733
especially with

134
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,300
the opportunity to move out here to Berlin um

135
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,200
so yeah from there

136
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,733
I started working on daily playlist

137
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,400
like back in like 2019

138
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,266
um with the original founder um

139
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,566
but also working across the host of projects which um

140
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,600
you mentioned there

141
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,266
and yeah what was it

142
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,400
like 2023 now

143
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,066
and then yeah

144
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,266
sort of now only working on daily playlists um

145
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,733
but yeah it was um

146
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,533
along the way picked up a whole host of um

147
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,200
experiences working across different technologies

148
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,133
I'm working with different types of music campaigns

149
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,766
looking at it from like the tech angle

150
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,000
but also still

151
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,866
looking at it from the independent artist angle

152
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,066
the label angle and uh

153
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,100
really keeping the post on what is going on within

154
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,900

155
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,366

00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,300
that's what so many of our listeners

163
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,466
especially are in that

164
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,300
that independent music space

165
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,400
but you know

166
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,766
combined with the business

167
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,800

168
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,666

00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:21,366
which I can get into a bit later um

193
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:24,300
for the curator inside the things we again

194
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,533
really pride ourselves in simplifying and automating

195
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,833
the processes where

196
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,666
the curators can organise

197
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,100
can fill the through submissions um

198
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,366
and can easily find the right music for their playlist

199
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,200
while also um

200
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,666
having a platform which allows them to grow

201
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,733
and monetize um

202
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,300
their brands and profiles

203
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
hmm so what

204
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,866
how does the

205
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,533
cause I believe if you got a free account

206
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,466
you can get 20 credits and is

207
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,200
is that essentially 20

208
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,200
submissions

209
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,533
is that right

210
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:50,966
yeah exactly

211
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,600
so that's a very much like a 1 to 1

212
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,266
um yeah value

213
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,400
okay so I I

214
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,166
I've submitted my

215
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,166
my music what's the

216
00:06:59,366 --> 00:06:59,900
what I mean

217
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,100
what's the I mean

218
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
70 people love daily playlist

219
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,066
cause you can submit to 20 playlists for free

220
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,466
what's the uh

221
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,866
how does the business model work

222
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:08,766
like how do you

223
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,100
you know how does the company

224
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,566
sort of make money if there's no financial

225
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,700
movement round it

226
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,533
so we do have two different monetization layers

227
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,200
so one of these is our Artist Pro

228
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,133
um layer which is a subscription plan

229
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,700
which you can get for 1499 per month

230
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,000
or hundred and fifty dollars per year

231
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:28,733
um which basically gives you tools

232
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,200
which allow you to make the most

233
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,166
of daily playlist

234
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,300
really expand on um

235
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,500
your experience

236
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,133
on the site

237
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:39,966
so um we can get into the individual products um

238
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,866
on a deeper level in a bit

239
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:43,966
but we have a tool which automates

240
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,466
automatically submits to playlist for you

241
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,900
um which we have a algorithm which you built

242
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,466
which can basically

243
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,866
match your submission to the playlist

244
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,466
um based on the playlist

245
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,366
like quality

246
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,700
um we also have the ability to add uh

247
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,666
pre saves to what we called the gate system

248
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,500
um which means that if you have a playlist

249
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,900
or if you wanna create a contest

250
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,966
you can then have the terms and conditions of the

251
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,266
entry or submission

252
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,366
to being pre saving the release

253
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,100
um and then also we um

254
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
have a number of other features

255
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,966
which include like uh

256
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:17,866
our trending list

257
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,100
our track Explorer

258
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,700
and very community based

259
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,566
engagement um

260
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,866
is because we have a very

261
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:24,966
very active community

262
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,066
which is super

263
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,533
um open but then on the other side

264
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,233
we have the premium layer for curators

265
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,966
in which we have a very

266
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:35,433
heavily vetted um

267
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,833
marketplace of curators who have got um

268
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,333
proven engagement

269
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:45,000
genuine um quality to the curation

270
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,133
and their branding

271
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,600
especially is what we look at

272
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,866
and just very much

273
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,266
established within the space

274
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,266
so for $2 per submission

275
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,733
you can submit to these curators

276
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,400
when we split that 60

277
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,666
40 in the curators favour

278
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,166
per submission that they review

279
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:03,766
ah gotchain

280
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:07,166
so can people just submit anytime to those

281
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,166
premium playlists

282
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,466
would you have to be on the membership model

283
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,633
for that to work

284
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,266
so anyone can buy

285
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:15,700
so we have two different um

286
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,666
credit types

287
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,766
we have the standard credits

288
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,700
which are the ones that you get every week to 20

289
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,533
that refresh on a Monday um

290
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,200
and then we also have the premium credits um

291
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
which you can purchase

292
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,666
I think for 20

293
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,366
um it is 39

294
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,300
99 and for 10 it's 1999 um

295
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,266
and then you can freely spend those premium credits to

296
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,533
the premium curators

297
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,200
so rather than submitting to an individual playlist

298
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
you submit to a curator

299
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:43,300
who then evaluates and gives you feedback on the um

300
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,500
on your submission and um

301
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,800
if it's a fit for their profile

302
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
they'll select which playlist and position

303
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,033
they wanna add you to

304
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,066
and whereas

305
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:54,100
I guess the difference from that to the standard

306
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,333
submissions is that on the standard side

307
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,466
you submit directly to a playlist

308
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,400
interesting yeah

309
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,366
so are you seeing then a trend

310
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:06,700
of when you talk about a curator is a

311
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,533
is a curator

312
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,433
like someone who manages

313
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:10,900
a bunch of playlists

314
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,800
essentially

315
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,166
in this case

316
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,966
yeah so curators

317
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,766
you know the world of music curation is huge

318
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:17,500
you haven't uh

319
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,100
channels such as like colours

320
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,166
um circle and those muscle

321
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,566
like even by boiling right there

322
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:24,100
like music curation in a

323
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,733
in a sense yeah

324
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,866
then you have

325
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,866
in our essence

326
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:31,200
you working with the playlisters who have um

327
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,966
assets which are the playlist

328
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,200
which they spend a lot of time mastering the growth

329
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,633
mastering the curation aspects and that branding

330
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,133
um and yeah

331
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,366
so that's that's how we

332
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:43,933
when I refer to curators on

333
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:44,500
in this case

334
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,433
I'm talking about like the playlist is

335
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,800
um so yeah gotcha

336
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,133
and when you're saying

337
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,466
is why you're submitting to the curators the

338
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,366
the premium and

339
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,300
and you'd get

340
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,933
they would review it

341
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,400
and see which playlist they would add it to

342
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,000
are you getting is this

343
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,566
is the artist submitting or whatever submitting

344
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,900
getting actual feedback from like

345
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,100
you know like

346
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,566
I guess the quality of the song or the style

347
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:09,466
or you know

348
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,333
are they getting that kind of constructive feedback

349
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,800
or is it more just yeah

350
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,166
we think we can work for it or no

351
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,066
we can't what

352
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,800
what sort of depth does it go to

353
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
so in the current setup

354
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,266
if a curator accepts the song

355
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,600
they don't necessarily have to leave a comment
